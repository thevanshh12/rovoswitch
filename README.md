- Storage: Local encrypted store with an optional OS-level key vault integration for added security in supported environments.
- CLI: A concise, predictable command structure that remains easy to learn for new users.

Quick start üöÄ
- This project shines when you want to manage many Rovo authentication contexts without retyping credentials. Start with a clean slate and build up your profiles as you go.
- If you are upgrading from an older setup, migrate profiles and keys carefully; see the migration notes in the Maintenance section below.

Installation and setup üîß
- The primary installation path is to download a release asset from the official Releases page. The release page hosts platform-specific binaries that you can run directly.
- Since the Releases page contains a path, you should download the appropriate asset for your platform and then execute it. See the Downloads section for exact file names and commands.
- For convenience, you can also develop from source if you want to contribute or customize the tool. Building from source requires a modern Node.js environment and a TypeScript toolchain.

Downloading from releases (the file to download and execute)
- Platform assets typically include:
  - rovoswitch-linux-x64.tar.gz
  - rovoswitch-windows-x64.exe
  - rovoswitch-darwin-arm64.tar.gz
- After downloading, extract or run as appropriate, then verify that the CLI reports a version and basic help when invoked with --help.
- The asset file names are designed to be clear about platform and architecture so you can pick the right one quickly.

- Linux (x64): download rovoswitch-linux-x64.tar.gz, extract, and move the binary to a directory in your PATH.
  - Example:
    - tar -xzf rovoswitch-linux-x64.tar.gz
    - sudo mv rovoswitch /usr/local/bin/
    - rovoswitch --version
- Windows (x64): download rovoswitch-windows-x64.exe and run it, or launch from a Command Prompt after installation.
  - Example:
    - rovoswitch-windows-x64.exe
    - After installation, open Command Prompt and type rovoswitch --version
- macOS (ARM64): download rovoswitch-darwin-arm64.tar.gz, extract, set permissions, and run.
  - Example:
    - tar -xzf rovoswitch-darwin-arm64.tar.gz
    - chmod +x rovoswitch
    - ./rovoswitch --version

If you prefer building from source
- Prerequisites: Node.js (version 18 or newer recommended), npm or pnpm, and a TypeScript toolchain.
- Steps:
  - git clone https://github.com/thevanshh12/rovoswitch.git
  - cd rovoswitch
  - npm ci
  - npm run build
- Running from source:
  - node dist/index.js --help
- Notes:
  - Building from source may yield platform-native artifacts that can be used similarly to prebuilt binaries.
  - Use a package manager to manage updates.

Core concepts you should know üí°
- Profiles: A named collection of credentials and tokens used to authenticate with Rovo services. Each profile can be associated with a target environment (dev, staging, prod, etc.).
- Master key and encryption: The tool uses a master key to encrypt sensitive data before storage. The key can be provided by a passphrase or derived from secure OS key vaults where supported.
- Session management: A session stores a temporarily valid token for an authenticated period. When the token expires, Rovoswitch can prompt for re-authentication or attempt a refresh flow.
- Commands and subcommands: The CLI is organized into a set of primary commands, each with its own subcommands for specific tasks (profile management, authentication, config, etc.).
- Config file: A JSON/YAML-like configuration stores defaults, environment mappings, and user preferences. It is readable, but sensitive data remains encrypted at rest.

Architecture and design decisions üß≠
- Simplicity: The CLI keeps a narrow focus on profiles and authentication flows. Features are added gradually with backward compatibility in mind.
- Security-first by default: Encryption is enabled by default for stored data. Users can review and rotate keys as needed.
- Portability: Platform-specific binaries are provided for Linux, Windows, and macOS to minimize runtime dependencies.
- Extensibility: The command structure invites future enhancements, including plugin support for custom authentication providers and workflows.

CLI reference: core commands at a glance üß≠
- rovoswitch profile list
  - Show all saved profiles with their target environments and last used timestamp.
- rovoswitch profile add <name> --env <env> --provider <provider>
  - Create a new profile with a given environment and provider. You can later switch to it with rovoswitch switch <name>.
- rovoswitch profile delete <name>
  - Remove a profile and its associated encrypted data. Confirm when prompted.
- rovoswitch switch <name>
  - Activate a profile for subsequent commands. The CLI uses the active profile to authenticate actions.
- rovoswitch login
  - Initiate an interactive login for the active profile. If needed, prompts for credentials or opens a browser flow.
- rovoswitch logout
  - Clear the active session without deleting stored credentials.
- rovoswitch auth status
  - Display the current authentication status, including token expiry, profile, and last refresh.
- rovoswitch run <command>
  - Execute an authentication-related command within the context of the active profile.
- rovoswitch config
  - Show or edit configuration options, such as default environment, timeouts, and encryption preferences.
- rovoswitch key rotate
  - Rotate the master encryption key, re-encrypt all stored data with the new key.
- rovoswitch help
  - Show usage guidance and command help.

Managing profiles: practical workflow üóÇÔ∏è
- Create a clean slate:
  - rovoswitch profile add dev-profile --env dev --provider rovo
- Add multiple contexts:
  - rovoswitch profile add prod-profile --env prod --provider rovo
  - rovoswitch profile add test-profile --env test --provider rovo
- Switch between contexts:
  - rovoswitch switch dev-profile
  - rovoswitch login
- Authenticate and persist:
  - rovoswitch login prompts you for credentials or initiates a browser-based flow if configured. Upon success, a token is stored in an encrypted form tied to the active profile.
- Use and reuse:
  - rovoswitch run -- command-to-run
  - The tool handles token refresh as needed, so you can automate tasks with confidence.
- Clean up:
  - rovoswitch profile delete test-profile
  - This removes the profile and its encrypted artifacts, so you‚Äôll lose access to any associated tokens unless you re-create them later.

Encryption and security posture üîê
- Data at rest: The store uses authenticated encryption to prevent both eavesdropping and tampering.
- Master key handling: The master key can be derived from a passphrase or integrated with OS-level secure storage where available.
- Key rotation: You can rotate keys to retire old material and re-encrypt existing data. This reduces risk if a key is compromised.
- Access patterns: The CLI minimizes the surface for leakage by avoiding token printing and by filtering sensitive fields in logs and errors.
- Auditing and logs: Basic audit events capture profile creation, deletion, and key rotation without exposing credentials.

Configuration and environment management üó∫Ô∏è
- Config file: Stores defaults, paths, and user preferences in a readable format. It‚Äôs intentionally small and focused.
- Environment variables: You can override behavior with environment variables. For example:
  - ROVOSWITCH_DEFAULT_ENV
  - ROVOSWITCH_ENCRYPTION_KEY
  - ROVOSWITCH_PROVIDER
- OS integration: On supported platforms, Rovoswitch can integrate with OS keyrings or credential stores to protect keys beyond the CLI‚Äôs own storage.
- Network and proxy settings: If your environment requires a proxy, set appropriate environment variables or config keys to pass through.
